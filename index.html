          “Winning the World Cup was very special because it meant so much to so many. One thing about our country that is constant is cricket.
           The smile it brought to people's faces was the thing I shall always remember.
           It reminded me, reminded all of us, of our importance to the lives of the Indian people less lucky than we are.”

                Mahendra Singh Dhoni popularly known as M.S.Dhoni was nicknamed captain cool, his level headedness and calm composure in trying situations earned him that nickname.

              Dhoni captained India when the team rose to the No 1 spot in the Test rankings for the first time in 2009.
              Dhoni was also the most successful Indian captain with 27 Test wins, eclipsing the legendary Sourav Ganguly's 21 victories before he was overtaken by Virat Kohli, with 36 wins and 14 losses.

              Dhoni is the fifth most successful wicket-keeper in Tests with 294 dismissals -- 256 catches and 38 stumpings. He is the third most successful glovesman in ODIs with 444 dismissals in 350 games, including 321 catches and 123 stumpings.
